## Requirements
Legal copies of Earth Defense Force 5 [![Steam](https://img.shields.io/badge/steam-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=steam&logoColor=white)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1007040/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_5/) & Earth Defense Force 6 

**Note** Illegal copies of Earth Defense Force 5 &-OR 6 will still work alongside this mod, but I, Nor the other modders will not help you if any issues arise

# What does this mod do to EDF 5 & 6

The Porting (Python & Batch script) will take the audio packages from EDF 5 and place them into the spots where the [BlueAmulet's Mod Loader](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDF5ModLoader) can see the files that will allow EDF 6 to use the content. While this package adds the missions & Subtitles for each respective languages, We are remaking all the missions of edf 5 from scratch within the edf 6 engine
