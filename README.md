## What does this mod do to EDF 5 & 6

The Porting (Python & Batch script) will take the audio packages from EDF 5 and place them into the spots where the [BlueAmulet's Mod Loader](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDF5ModLoader) can see the files that will allow EDF 6 to use the content. While this package adds the missions & Subtitles for each respective languages, This is remaking all the missions from edf 5 within the edf 6's updated XGS engine from scratch
