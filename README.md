## LINKS



## Requirements
Intstalation of [BlueAmulet's Mod Loader](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDF5ModLoader) with its optional plugins 6 zip file.

Legal copies of [Earth Defense Force 5](https://www.d3p.co.jp/edf5/) & [Earth Defense Force 6](https://www.d3p.co.jp/edf6/) 

**Note** Any illegal copy of Earth Defense Force 5 may work alongside this mod, but I, Nor the other modders will not help you if any issues arise. In addition [BlueAmulet's Mod Loader](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDF5ModLoader) will **NOT** work on any illegal copies of EDF for steam,

## What does this mod do to EDF 5 & 6

The Porting (Python & Batch script) will take the audio packages from EDF 5 and place them into the spots where the [BlueAmulet's Mod Loader](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDF5ModLoader) can see the files that will allow EDF 6 to use the content. While this package adds the missions & Subtitles for each respective languages, This is remaking all the missions from edf 5 within the edf 6's updated XGS engine from scratch

## Planed changes todo
 - Port EDF 5 missions onto EDF 6 and change "Online & Offline Mission pack" to "Complete Story Pack"
 - Adding Special Custom Textured Shoot-able Target in EACH mission that explode with crates once destroyed
 - Increase the max amount of loot that can drop (From 128) & can be picked up (From 1024)
 - Turrets, Helicopters, Tanks, & Mission Found Vehicles WILL be shared with Ranger and Air Raider, While Air Raider receives the EMC tanks, & Bikes
 - All cool and unique weapon that have like 2 weapons ie (Vulcan Hammer) will have a total of 8 versions
 - Air Raider will receive a new equipment slot.
 - All classes will receive equal equipment effects on some of the gear or new sets
	 1. Base Walking Speed: 5 - 20% boost on AR and WD
	 2. Item Acquisition Radius
	 3. Speed Reduction (Being Hit)
	 4. Knocked Down by Blast Wave Immunity
	 5. Lock-on Speed
	 6. Lock-on Range
	 7. Ally Amount healed (Heal Items Obtained)
 - The best tier of equipment "Storm One Equipment"  at every 50 levels in count will emulate 80% of the best equipment stats up to the current item level
 - SsethTzeentach's Complaint on Wingdiver's guns having "-has a fucking magazine" on weapon selection menu
 - Re-import the boss from EDF 5 into EDF 6 (Hopefully they keep the same xgs_scene_object_class name)
 - Fix Any Translation Errors Example: "Combat Frame" with "Powered Exoskeleton" is incorrect on item names
 - Max Weapon Level might reach 250~
 - Meme gun category for all classes:
 - More loading screen tips
 - Eventually make a mission content adding generator, to be other mod friendly!
 - SEE OTHER AIR RAIDERS IN MISSIONS (Just ranger's in desguise)
